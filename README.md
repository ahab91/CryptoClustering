# CryptoClustering

## Overview

In this project, I used scikit-learn and pandas on a cryptocurrency dataset to prepare a dataframe for K-means clustering. I utilized the elbow method to find the best value for K by plotting my inertia values into a line chart. From there I grouped the cryptocurrencies into clusters and prepared a scatterplot that illustrated where each cryptocurrency was grouped. From there I performed a principal components analysis to optimize my clusters and charted the values with my new best value for k. Finally, I created a composite view of my elbow plots and scatter plots to highlight the difference between the two methods.
